*A Modular Toolkit for Synthetic RNA Design*

Welcome to **FoldRNA**, a curated, open-source collection of RNA elements for use in synthetic biology, molecular diagnostics, and programmable therapeutics.

This project is built to be a **public library of functional RNA parts**—aptamers, riboswitches, ribozymes, and synthetic control elements—annotated with sequence data, folding predictions, and design-use guides.

Whether you're engineering a biosensor, building a synthetic circuit, or just trying to figure out how to make a riboswitch behave for once in its life, this toolkit is for you.

## 🧩 What You'll Find Here

- ✅ **RNA Elements**: Modular, validated RNA parts with sequence + folding info
- 📐 **Design Notes**: Tips for integration into synthetic circuits and workflows
- 🔬 **Simulations**: Predicted secondary structures (ViennaRNA, NUPACK)
- 💡 **Use Cases**: Diagnostic, therapeutic, and research applications
- 📚 **Mini-Tutorials**: Markdown-based design walkthroughs

## 🧪 Who This Is For

- Wet lab scientists working on RNA-based tools
- Bioengineers designing circuits or synthetic constructs
- Educators teaching molecular biology
- Mad geniuses working on RNA origami in their garages
- You. Obviously.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Want to contribute or use a part? Start with:

- `/elements/`: Contains subfolders by part type (e.g. `aptamers`, `riboswitches`)
- `/tutorials/`: Markdown files walking through use cases and integration
- `/tools/`: Scripts and notebooks for folding, structure prediction, and sequence tweaking

You can clone this repo and run prediction tools using provided scripts (coming soon).

## 🌱 Status

This project is in its early phase. We’re beginning with a small number of high-confidence RNA parts and expanding rapidly. All contributors welcome.
